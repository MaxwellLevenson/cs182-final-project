# cs182-final-project

Goal: Improve upon naive-BFS on social graphs with a homemade, trained heuristic (taking inspiration from clustering).

Run using `python app.py`.

TODO:
- Graph generation
  - Adjaceny list/matrix?
  - Improve vectors of connection between people
    - Dependent factors?
- Heuristic training
  - Work on proving validity of heuristic
  - Improve dimensionality of heuristic space
- Data visualization
- Possible extensions: DLS, 2 sided-BFS

Done:
- Naive BFS implementation
- A\* implementation
- Basic graph generation
- Basic heuristic training
