# cs182-final-project

Goal: Improve upon naive-BFS on social graphs with a homemade, trained heuristic (taking inspiration from clustering).

Run using `python app.py`.

Implementations:
- Graph generation
  - Adjaceny list
  - Improve vectors of connection between people
    - Dependent factors
- Naive BFS 
- DLS, 2 sided-BFS
- A\* implementation
- Heuristic training
  - Work on proving validity of heuristic
  - Improve dimensionality of heuristic space
- Data visualization
